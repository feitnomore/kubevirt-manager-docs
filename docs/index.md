# Welcome to the Documentation

kubevirt-manager is a lightweight, user-friendly web interface for managing [KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.io/) environments. It aims to make virtualization on Kubernetes accessible, transparent, and efficientâ€”whether you are running a small home lab, an edge cluster, or a large-scale deployment.

With kubevirt-manager, you can create, configure, and monitor Virtual Machines (VMs), Virtual Machine Pools and Kubernetes Clusters directly from your browser, without having to memorize complex CLI commands or YAML manifests. The interface is designed for both newcomers exploring KubeVirt and experienced operators managing production workloads.

This documentation provides comprehensive guides, tutorials, and references to help you get the most out of the tool, from initial installation to advanced configurations.
